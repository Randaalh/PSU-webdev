  <p> Paragraphs are block elements so that is why 
    you see that whenever you create a new paragraph they are stacked 
    below one another </p>

  however that is not recommended since all styling should be done using CSS -->
  <p> <b>bold text</b></p> <!-- bold text made possable using the <b> tag -->
    
  <p> <i>italicied text</i></p> <!-- itaicied text made possable using the <i> tag -->

    <!-- There are a number of other tags that help style such as <em> <strong> <sub> and so on you may google them if you want to check out more -->
